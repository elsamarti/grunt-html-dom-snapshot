## if-then-else

Conditional command consisting of two or three three instructions, which each points to a sub-command or to an array of sub-commands to perform:

### if
Type: `Object` | `Array` (mandatory)

### then
Type: `Object` | `Array` (optional)

### else
Type: `Object` | `Array` (optional)

At first the sub-commands from the `if` instruction are performed. If they succeed, the execution continues with sub-commands from the `then` instruction. If they fail, the execution continues with sub-commands from the `else` instruction. The success or failure of the whole conditional command will depend on either of `then` and `else` instructions, which are executed. The success or failure of the `if` instruction decides only the following condition branch.

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  wait: '#lst-ib'
},
{
  if: {
    hasAttribute: {
      selector: '#lst-ib',
      name: 'autocomplete',
      value: 'off'
    }
  },
  then: {
    setValue: {
      selector: '#lst-ib',
      value: 'why is autocomplete off'
    }
  }
},
{
  file: 'google'
}
```

## while-do

Cyclic command with the condition evaluated before the loop body. If the condition evaluates to a truthy value, the loop body will be executed. Then the condition will be evaluated again and so on. The command consists of two instructions, which each points to a sub-command or to an array of sub-commands to evaluate and perform:

### while
Type: `Object` | `Array` (mandatory)

### do
Type: `Object` | `Array` (optional)

At first the sub-commands from the `while` instruction are performed. If they succeed, the execution continues with sub-commands from the `do` instruction. If they fail, sub-commands from the `do` instruction will be skipped and the execution will continue with the next command. The success or failure of the whole cyclic command will depend on the loop body in the `do` instruction. The success or failure of the `while` instruction decides only if the loop is entered or not.

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  wait: '#lst-ib'
},
{
  while: {
    isNotFocused: '#lst-ib'
  },
  do: {
    keys: ['Tab']
  }
},
{
  file: 'google'
}
```

## do-until

Cyclic command with the condition evaluated after the loop body. The loop body will be executed and then the condition evaluated. If it evaluates to a falsy value, the loop body will be executed again and so on. The command consists of two instructions, which each points to a sub-command or to an array of sub-commands to evaluate and perform:

### do
Type: `Object` | `Array` (optional)

### until
Type: `Object` | `Array` (mandatory)

At first the sub-commands from the `do` instruction are performed. Then the sub-commands from the `until` instruction are performed. If they succeed, the execution will continue with the next command. The success or failure of the `until` instruction decides only if the loop is re-entered or not. The success or failure of the whole cyclic command will depend on the loop body in the `do` instruction.

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  wait: '#lst-ib'
},
{
  do: {
    keys: ['Tab']
  },
  until: {
    isFocused: '#lst-ib'
  }
},
{
  file: 'google'
}
```

## repeat-do

Cyclic command with the known count of repetitions of the loop body. The loop body will be executed the specified count of times. The command consists of two instructions, which one points to a repetition count and the other to a sub-command or to an array of sub-commands to perform:

### repeat
Type: `Number` (mandatory)

### do
Type: `Object` | `Array` (optional)

At first the current repetition count is compared to the specified target one. If if is less, the execution continues with sub-commands from the `do` instruction. It it is greater or equal to it, sub-commands from the `do` instruction will be skipped and the execution will continue with the next command. Then the current repetition count is incremented by one and the condition evaluated again and so  on. The success or failure of the whole cyclic command will depend on the loop body in the `do` instruction.

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  wait: '#lst-ib'
},
{
  repeat: 10,
  do: {
    click: '#lst-ib'
  }
},
{
  isFocused: '#lst-ib',
  file: 'google'
}
```

#### setViewport
Type: `Object`

Resizes the web browser viewport to the specified `width` and `height` values (in pixels), overriding the `viewport` value in `options`. Once this instruction is used, the viewport size will stay, until it is modified by this instruction again, or until the `viewport` option is detected in another instruction.

If the input object for this instruction is left empty (`{}`), the viewport will be resized to the original value set in `options`.

```js
{
  setViewport: {with: 640, height: 480},
  url: 'https://google.com',
  file: 'google'
}
```

## url
Type: `String`

Navigates (changes the current window location) to the specified URL.

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  file: 'google'
}
```

If it is omitted, the command will reuse the location from the previous command. A command without URL can cause some page changes, wait for an element state and/or save a snapshot.

## go
Type: `String`: 'back', 'forward' or 'refresh'

Navigates backwards or forwards using the browser history, or refreshes the current page.

```js
{
  go: 'back',
  file: 'previous'
}
```

## scroll
Type: `String` | `Object`

Scrolls the page, so that the element with the specified selector or mouse coordinates become visible. If an object is used for the specification, it should contain the following properties:

* `selector` - `String` - selector of the element to move the mose to.
* `offset` - `Object` - relative offset to the top left corner of the specified element expected as `left` and `top` numeric properties.

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  scroll: {
    selector: '#lst-ib'
  },
  file: 'google'
}
```

The `offset` value can be specified instead of the `selector` and shares the format with the [`moveCursor`](#moveCursor) instruction.

## focus
Type: `String`

Focuses the the specified element by JavaScript.

The input string should contain selector of the element to set focus to.

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  wait: '#lst-ib',
  focus: 'input[name=btnK]',
  file: 'google'
}
```

## clearValue
Type: `String`

Set value of an input element either by providing the new value or using [keyboard key identifiers]. The previous value will be cleared. The object should contain the following properties:

* `selector` - `String` - selector of an input element.
* `value` - `String|Number|Array` - string or numeric value, or an array of keys (strings) to send to the element for setting its value.

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  setValue: {
    selector: '#lst-ib',
    value: 'Hi'
  }
},
{
  setValue: {
    selector: '#lst-ib',
    value: ['Enter']
  }
  file: 'google',
}
```

## addValue
Type: `Object`

Appends to the current value of an input element. The object should contain the following properties:

* `selector` - `String` - selector of an input element.
* `value` - `String|Number` - string or numeric value.

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  setValue: {
    selector: '#lst-ib',
    value: ' there!'
  },
  file: 'google'
}
```

## selectOptionByIndex
Type: `Object`

Select an `option` element of a `select` element by the specified (zero-based)
index. The object should contain the following properties:

* `selector` - `String` - selector of a select element.
* `index` - `Number` - numeric (0-based integer) index of an option to select.

```js
{
  url: 'https://example.com',
  setValue: {
    selector: 'select',
    index: 1 // select second option
  }
}
```

## selectOptionByValue

the `value` attribute. The object should contain the following properties:

* `selector` - `String` - selector of a select element.
* `value` - `String` - value of the `value` attribute of an option to select.

```js
{
  url: 'https://example.com',
  setValue: {
    selector: 'select',
    value: 'second'
  }
}
```

## moveCursor
Type: `String` | `Object`

Moves the mouse cursor to an element with the specified selector. If an object is used for the specification, it should contain the following properties:

* `selector` - `String` - selector of the element to move the mose to.
* `offset` - `Object` - relative offset to the top left corner of the specified element expected as `left` and `top` numeric properties.

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  moveCursor: {
    selector: '#lst-ib',
    offset: {
      left: 10
      top: 5,
    }
  },
  file: 'google'
}
```

  click: 'input[name=btnK]',
  file: 'google'
}
```

## keys
Type: `String|Array`

Sends either a text (string) typed by keys, or single keystrokes (array) to the browser. Special keys are documented here https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#keyboard-actions

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  click: 'input[name=btnK]',
  keys: ['abc', 'Enter'],
  file: 'google'
}
```

## wait
Type: `Number` | `String` | `Function` | `Array` (optional)

Delays taking of the snapshot until a condition s met depending on the value type:

`Number` - number of milliseconds to wait:

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  wait: 1000,
  file: 'google'
}
```

`String` - selector of a node to look for. As soon as this node is found in DOM, the waiting will stop:

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  wait: '#footer',
  file: 'google'
}
```

If the selector is prefixed by the exclamation mark ("!"), the waiting waiting will stop, once the node disappears from DOM:

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  wait: '!.gsfi',
  file: 'google'
}
```

`Function` - callback, which is supposed to return a `Promise`. Once this promise is resolved, the waiting will stop. The callback obtains the [webdriverio] client instance and can use [WebdriverIO API] to interact with the browser:

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  wait: function (browser) {
    return browser.waitForExist('#footer', 1000);
  },
  file: 'google'
}
```

`Array` - an array of items of types described above. They will be processed one by one. Once the last one is finished, the waiting will stop:

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  wait: '!.gsfi',
  file: 'google'
}
```

If `wait` is omitted, the task will advance to another item without delay. It can still save a snapshot immediately.

## hasAttribute
Type: `Object`

Checks, that the attribute with the specified value exists in the element with the specified selector. The input object should contain the following properties:

* `selector` - `String` - selector of the element to check.
* `name` - `String` - attribute name.
* `value` - `String` - attribute value.

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  wait: '#lst-ib',
  hasAttribute: {
    selector: '#lst-ib',
    name: 'autocomplete',
    value: 'off'
  },
  file: 'google'
}
```

## hasClass
Type: `Object`

Checks, that at least one of the specified classes is included or omitted in the element with the specified selector. The input object should contain the following properties:

* `selector` - `String` - selector of the element to check.
* `value` - `String` - space-delimited class list.
* `allRequired` - `Boolean` - if all classes in the list have to match. Optional. The default value is `false`.

Class names starting with the exclamation mark ("!") are expected to be omitted, otherwise the class names are expected to be included in the specified element.

The check will succeed, if at least one class from the list will be included or omitted. If you want all classes to pass the check, set the instruction property `allRequired` to `true`. (Or use multiple commands with the `hasClass` instruction.)

```js
{
  url: 'https://google.com',
  wait: '#lst-ib',
  hasClass: {
    selector: '#lst-ib',
    value: 'gsfi !hidden',
